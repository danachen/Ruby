Tic Tac Toe with bonus features. 

Features implemented:
- Improved join features
- Keeps scores of each player
- Keeps last game moves
- AI defensive and offensive moves
- Human player picking the marker
- Name setting for player and computer

I also created classes for human and computer players, so that the program can potentially support multi-player features in the future.
